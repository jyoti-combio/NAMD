set all [atomselect top all]
set fix [atomselect top "protein and name N"] (the name of your atom can
be HA, CA, O, C, etc., or if you want to fix; but if you want to fix the
backbone type:

set fix [atomselect top protein and backbone] )

after that, you have to type the following:

$all set beta 0
$fix set beta 1

And finally:

$all writepdb your_molecule_with_fixed_atoms.pdb
